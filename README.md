# SALES-PREDICTION-USING-PYTHON
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. 

#Sales Prediction Dataset
This dataset contains information about sales data for a product/service-based business, including factors such as advertising spend, target audience segment, and advertising platform. The goal is to predict future sales using machine learning techniques in Python.

#Task
The task is to predict future sales based on factors such as advertising spend, target audience segment, and advertising platform. This involves using machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

#Usage
1.Download the Dataset: Download the dataset Advertising.csv from this repository.

2.Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. You can install them using pip:

 code : pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
 If you want to use specific versions, you can specify them in a requirements.txt file and 
 install them using:

 code : pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Load and Explore the Data: Load the dataset into your Python environment using pandas and explore its structure, including columns, data types, and summary statistics.

4. Preprocess the Data: Preprocess the dataset as necessary, including handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding), and splitting the data into features (independent variables) and target variable (sales).

5. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the machine learning model on one subset and evaluate its performance on another.

6. Select a Model: Choose a suitable regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) for predicting sales based on the features.

7. Train the Model: Train the selected model on the training data, fitting it to learn the relationship between the features and sales.

8. Evaluate the Model: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, or others.

9. Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data to estimate future sales.

10. Iterate and Improve: Iterate on the modeling process by trying different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
